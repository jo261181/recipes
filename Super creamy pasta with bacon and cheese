1 Cook the spaghetti according to the instructions on the packaging until al dente.

2 In the meantime, heat a frying pan without butter or oil and fry the bacon strips for 5-8 minutes until crispy. Finely chop the garlic and fry with the bacon for the last 30 seconds. Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.

3 In the meantime, beat the eggs with the whipped cream and mix in the cheese. Drain the pasta, but reserve a cup of cooking water. Return it to the pan and stir in the bacon and egg mixture.
