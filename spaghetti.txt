Ingredients 

300 g spaghetti or other type of pasta 
800 ml garden herb stock (Maggi) 
390 g tomato cubes (Heinz) 
200 g tomato sauce
1 onion 
3 tablespoons dried oregano
3 cloves of garlic 
2 tsp Italian herbs 
100 g parmesan cheese 
pinch of salt and pepper 
fresh basil 

Preparation 
Chop the onion and finely chop the cloves of garlic.
Put the spaghetti in a (large) pan together with the garlic, onion, herbs, tomato cubes and parmesan cheese.
Pour in the stock and bring everything to the boil. 
Let it cook for 10-15 minutes (without a lid on the pan) until the pasta is cooked and the sauce has thickened. 
Stir occasionally so that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.

Serve with some extra grated cheese and fresh basil. Enjoy!
