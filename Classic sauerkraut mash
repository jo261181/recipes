Preparation time: 10 Minutes
Number of persons: 25

Ingredients:
900 g floury potatoes
500 g sauerkraut
125 g lean bacon strips
1 Unox Gelderse Rookworst
200 ml semi-skimmed milk
1 vegetable stock cube
50 g margarine
salt

Preparation:
Peel the potatoes and cut them into pieces.

Put the potatoes in a pan and fill the pan with cold water until the whole is almost covered. Bring the potatoes to the boil and let them simmer gently for ± 20 minutes until done (you can prick them with a fork). Drain the potatoes and let them evaporate with the lid tilted on the pan.

Stew the sauerkraut in a layer of water for ± 20 minutes until done. In the meantime, heat a frying pan and fry the bacon strips until crispy. Let them drain on a piece of kitchen paper. Heat the Gelderse Rookworst according to the preparation instructions on the packaging.

In a saucepan, bring the milk with the butter and the stock cube to a boil over low heat. Stir occasionally.

Mash the potatoes into a puree and add the sauerkraut. Add the milk mixture and margarine little by little and stir well until you have a nice whole. Add the bacon and stir. Serve the classic sauerkraut mash with the sliced ​​smoked sausage.
